# Assignment 1 - Directions
## Driving Route Finder

In this first part we implement
the server-side of the required functionality:

1. Routines for building the graph by reading the provided text file.
2. A cost function class for computing edge weights.
3. A routine for computing least cost paths efficiently.
4. A python route finding server that accepts route finding requests and provides paths through the
specified protocol. Communication is done via stdin and stdout

We first implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the least
cost path, and built a graph from an CSV file.
The cost function class was used to #@Tamara what does this do lol


## Required files from 'Helpful functions' folder:
* binary_heap.py
* breadth_first_search.py
* graph.py

## Modifications to files:

* line 2 in binary_heap.py was commented out
  ```
  from heapviz import *
  ```
